This document represent the Requirement Analysis and Specification Document (RASD). The main goal of this document is to completely describe the system in terms of functional and non-functional requirements, analyse the real need of the customer to modelling the system, show the constraints and the limit of the software and simulate the typical use cases that will occur after the development. This document is intended to all developer and programmer who have to implement the requirements, to system analyst who want to integrate other system with this one, and could be used as a contractual basis between the customer and the developer.
