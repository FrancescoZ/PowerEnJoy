%TODO Identify all tools and test equipment needed to accomplish the integration. Refer to the tools presented during the lectures. Explain why and how you are going to use them. Note that you may also use manual testing for some part. Consider manual testing as one of the possible tools you have available.
The following part of the document contains a set of recommended software that can be used to implement the concrete procedure of testing.
Moreover, because the high-level architecture proposed in the \textbf{DD} is designed using a \textbf{Java-based} style, the programming language that better adapts to this style is \textbf{Java}, but a lot of other emerging languages can be used in order to build a proper software, like \textbf{Swift}.\par
If it is decided to use \textbf{Java}, the proposed and well-known tools are:
\begin{itemize}	
	\itemBold {JUnit} Unit testing framework.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item
