Before starting the integration testing of any software component that has been designed for \PowerEnJoy{} system, the internal functions of the considered component (i.e. public or protected methods that are exposed within the package of the component but are not part of any external public interface) must be unit tested using an appropriate framework.
\section{Elements to be integrated}
\PowerEnJoy{} as shown in the \textbf{DD} is a three-tier system composed by:
\begin{itemize}
	\itemBold{DBMS} The memory of \PowerEnJoy{} entire system
	\itemBold{PowerEnJoy System} The main server and the main core composed by:
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Data Manager
			\item Account Manager
			\item Ride Manager
			\item Bill Manager
			\item Map Services
			\item Notification
			\item Car Manager
			\item Zone Manager
			\item Problem Manager
		\end{enumerate}
	\itemBold{Client Application} Subdivided in \textbf{Car System} and \textbf{Mobile Application}
\end{itemize}
Moreover we assume that that Google Maps API and Paypal are well tested by their owner and thus we can use them without testing any further.
