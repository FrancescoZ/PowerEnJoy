The integration testing strategy, conducted in this project, is a \textbf{bottom-up} approach. This strategy tests the lower level components and start testing a way upwards to higher level components. The advantage of this strategy is that allow us to maintain the code easier, smaller modules have unit tests and there is a clearer structure of how to do things. The disadvantage is that when releasing a prototype it's impossible to see a working prototype until nearly all the program has been completed so that may take a long time before this happens. In early development, testing tools as Mockito and Arquillian (described in Chapter 4) allow us to test components which depend on incomplete ones through stubs and drivers (Chapter 5). The usage of the selected approach will create a robust application with efforts concentrated in testing the Server parts before all.
