This section describes the specification of stubs and drivers needed to replace the part of software components that still don?t exist and test the others. This is necessary to perform the integration steps. DBMS should contain sample data in order to perform proper test cases. We assume that the \textbf{Integration testing} comes after \textbf{Developing} and \textbf{Unit testing}. In this way we don't need any \textbf{Driver} because the software components are already developed.\par
On the other hand we need few \textbf{Stubs} in order to make the not yet integrated components work, because we want to respect the \textbf{Bottom-Up} strategy.\par
To better catch the need for introducing \textbf{Stubs}, an example of a specific \textbf{Stub} usage is proposed below.\par
In order to integrate the \textbf{Car System} in \textbf{-----} we need a component that mocks \textbf{Car System} functionalities in a predefined way. We have decided to introduce its \textbf{Stub} because
The real \textbf{Map Service} will be integrated when the integration procedure arrives to \textbf{Map Service}.\par
In \textbf{I1} there is the need for some sample data to be in the \textbf{Database}, and in \textbf{I13} some sample GPS data are needed.
