This OFBiz component offers a fully utilised component for request, quote, order and requirements management.
This class in particular is charged to retrieval the product that can be then payed and managed by the other class in the
package.
In particular we have three main methods:
\begin{itemize}
  \itemBold{getRandomCartProductAssoc}
  Although its name, this method categories the product in order to
  apply a sort of \texlf{Recommened System Algorithm}. This is done by adding the product for
  each category and then delete all the surplus element on the list including the product into the cart.
  \itemBold{getQuickReorderProducts}
  This method reorder the the product in a list contained in the request basing its computation
  on the category, if specified, and on the number on element present in the database.
  \itemBold{productOrderByMap}
  This method order a list of item using a comparator \textbf{ProductByMapComparator} that implements the comparable interface
  in order to decide how to order the component in the map structure. 
\end{itemize}
