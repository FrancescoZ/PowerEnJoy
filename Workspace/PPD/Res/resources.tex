This section covers the problem of allocating the human resources to each task in order to respect the identified scheduling.
We are a group of two people, and we do not have any kind of concurrency in the tasks that we identified, so we are going to work together on the same task at the same time during the whole duration of the project.
As shown before the project can be managed by more or less two people in nine months, and this respects the scheduling we devised.

\section{Staff Allocation Charts}
A chart is provided for the best visualization of the staff allocation.
For graphical issues, some consecutive tasks are merged one into the other.
